## About the Summer School

**Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD)** is increasingly used to study liquids and interfaces in regimes where continuum descriptions break down — from nanoscale flows and wetting to heat transfer, lubrication, and semiconductor processing. Yet for many researchers, NEMD remains difficult to access: its fundamentals are rarely taught in a unified way, and practical guidance on extracting reliable transport properties is often scattered across the literature.

**This summer school is designed to bridge that gap.**

We focus on the **fundamental ideas, practical techniques, and common pitfalls** of using molecular dynamics to study non-equilibrium transport in liquids and at interfaces, with an emphasis on results that can be connected to continuum models and emerging technological applications.

The school is aimed at early-career researchers who:

- already use molecular dynamics, but want a **deeper understanding of its theoretical foundations**, and/or
- are interested in studying **liquids, interfaces, and transport phenomena** using NEMD for the first time.

**No prior experience with non-equilibrium methods is assumed.**

The programme covers:

- **MD fundamentals, revisited** — core theory and modelling assumptions, including a guided session on building a simple MD solver to demystify how simulations work
- **Non-equilibrium methods for liquids and interfaces** — imposing flow and thermal gradients, and computing viscosity, heat flux, slip lengths, and surface tension
- **Practical NEMD workflows** — thermostats, driving methods, finite-size effects, and uncertainty in transport coefficients
- **Multiscale connections** — linking molecular results to continuum descriptions and engineering models
- **Software and modern tools** — LAMMPS, Python-based workflows, and machine-learning potentials
- **Emerging applications** — how NEMD is used in current research and industrially relevant problems, including semiconductor and thermal-fluid systems

The emphasis throughout is on **physical understanding, reproducible workflows, and transferable skills**, rather than black-box simulation.
