## Programme

The summer school runs over two intensive days, covering fundamentals through to cutting-edge applications of NEMD with a focus on **fluid dynamics** and **interfacial phenomena**. Topics include viscosity, heat flux, slip lengths, liquid-vapour surface tension, and multiscale modelling approaches for nanoscale fluids.

## How is this summer school different?

Many molecular simulation schools focus either on broad introductions to molecular dynamics or on specific techniques such as machine-learning potentials.

This school takes a different approach. We focus on **non-equilibrium molecular dynamics for liquids and interfaces**, emphasising:

- physical understanding of transport processes
- practical methods for extracting viscosity, heat flux, slip, and surface tension
- common pitfalls and uncertainty in non-equilibrium simulations
- connecting molecular-scale results to continuum and engineering models

The aim is not to cover all of molecular simulation, but to provide a **coherent and accessible foundation** for researchers who want to use MD to study transport and interfacial phenomena with confidence.
