## Programme

The summer school runs over two intensive days, covering fundamentals through to cutting-edge applications of NEMD for **fluids and interfaces**. Topics include slip lengths, heat fluxes, interfacial thermal transport, liquid-vapour interfaces, auto-correlation methods, machine learning potentials, and multiscale modelling, with hands-on sessions on ARCHER2.

## How is this summer school different?

Many molecular simulation schools focus either on broad introductions to molecular dynamics or on specific techniques such as machine-learning potentials.

This school takes a different approach. We focus on **non-equilibrium molecular dynamics for liquids and interfaces**, emphasising:

- physical understanding of transport processes
- practical methods for extracting viscosity, heat flux, slip, and surface tension
- common pitfalls and uncertainty in non-equilibrium simulations
- connecting molecular-scale results to continuum and engineering models

The aim is not to cover all of molecular simulation, but to provide a **coherent and accessible foundation** for researchers who want to use MD to study transport and interfacial phenomena with confidence.

**Note:** Schedule is preliminary and subject to change. Each day follows a morning theory, afternoon practice format: concepts introduced in morning lectures are applied during hands-on sessions on ARCHER2, the UK's national supercomputer, with support from EPCC training staff.

### Venue

All sessions will be held at the **King's Buildings Campus, University of Edinburgh**. Detailed venue information and directions will be provided to registered participants.
