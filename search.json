    "section": "About the Summer School",
    "text": "About the Summer School\nNon-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) is increasingly used to study liquids and interfaces in regimes where continuum descriptions break down — from nanoscale flows and wetting to heat transfer, lubrication, and semiconductor processing. Yet for many researchers, NEMD remains difficult to access: its fundamentals are rarely taught in a unified way, and practical guidance on extracting reliable transport properties is often scattered across the literature.\nThis summer school is designed to bridge that gap.\nWe focus on the fundamental ideas, practical techniques, and common pitfalls of using molecular dynamics to study non-equilibrium transport in liquids and at interfaces, with an emphasis on results that can be connected to continuum models and emerging technological applications.\nThe school is aimed at early-career researchers who:\n\nalready use molecular dynamics, but want a deeper understanding of its theoretical foundations, and/or\nare interested in studying liquids, interfaces, and transport phenomena using NEMD for the first time.\n\nNo prior experience with non-equilibrium methods is assumed.\nThe programme covers:\n\nMD fundamentals, revisited — core theory and modelling assumptions, including a guided session on building a simple MD solver to demystify how simulations work\nNon-equilibrium methods for liquids and interfaces — imposing flow and thermal gradients, and computing viscosity, heat flux, slip lengths, and surface tension\nPractical NEMD workflows — thermostats, driving methods, finite-size effects, and uncertainty in transport coefficients\nMultiscale connections — linking molecular results to continuum descriptions and engineering models\nSoftware and modern tools — LAMMPS, Python-based workflows, and machine-learning potentials\nEmerging applications — how NEMD is used in current research and industrially relevant problems, including semiconductor and thermal-fluid systems\n\nThe emphasis throughout is on physical understanding, reproducible workflows, and transferable skills, rather than black-box simulation."
