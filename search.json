    "section": "About the Summer School",
    "text": "About the Summer School\nNon-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) is increasingly used to study liquids and interfaces in regimes where continuum descriptions break down, from nanoscale flows and wetting to heat transfer, lubrication, and semiconductor processing. Yet for many researchers, NEMD remains difficult to access: its fundamentals are rarely taught in a unified way, and practical guidance on extracting reliable transport properties is often scattered across the literature.\nThis summer school is designed to bridge that gap.\nWe focus on the fundamental ideas, practical techniques, and common pitfalls of using molecular dynamics to study non-equilibrium transport in liquids and at interfaces, with an emphasis on results that can be connected to continuum models and emerging technological applications.\nThe school is aimed at researchers who:\n\nalready use MD for fluids but want rigorous grounding in NEMD theory, and/or\nare new to NEMD and want to apply it to fluids and interfaces.\n\nSome knowledge of equilibrium statistical mechanics and molecular simulation methods is useful but not essential.\nThe programme covers:\n\nFundamentals: NEMD theory for fluids and interfaces\nInterfacial properties: solid/liquid/vapour systems\nTransport phenomena: slip lengths, heat fluxes, and interfacial thermal transport\nNanoscale hydrodynamics: when classical theory breaks down and how to extend it\nMachine learning potentials: for fluids and interfaces\nMultiscale modelling: linking molecular results to continuum descriptions\nApplications: current research landscape and industrial use cases\nHands-on HPC sessions: run LAMMPS simulations on ARCHER2, the UK’s national supercomputer, with dedicated support from EPCC (Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre) training experts\n\nThe emphasis throughout is on physical understanding, reproducible workflows, and transferable skills, rather than black-box simulation."
